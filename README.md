# ChromeWallpaper
Personalized Chrome Wallpaper Extension


# How to use
First clone repo to local machine.
If you want to use the basic wallpaper function stay in the main branch.
If you want to remove sponsored results, checkout to branch: noSpon
To edit the wallpapers simply add wallpapers into the wallpaper folder, and create a new chrome.runtime.getURL("wallpaper/image"), in the top of Script.js
If you want to quickly change the image you can click on the extension on the top right of google and paste an image link into the popup and reload the page.



### To run this program
Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on Dev mode in the top right.
Next, select "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the folder you cloned the repo into.
Then toggle the extension, and reload Chrome.
Chome may ask if you wish to continue with the extension when you first unpack and open a new tab. 
If you make changes to the code ensure you reload the extension in the chrome://extensions/ page to see those changes
